# Blackhole Hardware Performance Counters

Blackhole A0 Tensix tiles expose 94 hardware performance counters accessible via the TRISC1 (MATH thread) RISC-V core. These counters measure compute unit utilization, unpacker/packer pipeline activity, NoC traffic, L1 arbitration, and coprocessor instruction issue statistics.

Counters are read via debug registers. Each sample provides:
- `counter_value`: event count or busy-cycle count
- `ref_cnt`: reference cycle count for the sampling window
- `util_pct`: `counter_value / ref_cnt * 100`

## Counter Groups

6 counter groups, selected via `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_PERF_CNT_MUX_CTRL`:

| Bit | Mask | Group | Control register | Counters |
|-----|------|-------|-----------------|----------|
| 0 | `0x01` | FPU | `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_PERF_CNT_FPU0` | 3 |
| 1 | `0x02` | PACK | `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_PERF_CNT_TDMA_PACK0` | 3 |
| 2 | `0x04` | UNPACK | `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_PERF_CNT_TDMA_UNPACK0` | 11 |
| 3 | `0x08` | L1_0 | `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_PERF_CNT_L1_0` | 8 |
| 4 | `0x10` | L1_1 | Same as L1_0, MUX bit 4 = 1 | 8 |
| 5 | `0x20` | INSTRN | `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_PERF_CNT_INSTRN_THREAD0` | 61 |

L1_0 and L1_1 share the same hardware register block. `RISCV_DEBUG_REG_PERF_CNT_MUX_CTRL` bit 4 selects which channel: 0 = NOC ring 0 / L1 arbitration, 1 = NOC ring 1 / TDMA.

## FPU (3)

Measures compute unit utilization. `util_pct` gives the fraction of the measurement window the unit was actively executing instructions.

| Counter | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `FPU` | Cycles the Matrix Unit (FPU) was executing instructions (matrix multiply, element-wise ops on low-precision data) |
| `SFPU` | Cycles the Vector Unit (SFPU) was executing instructions (32-lane SIMD on FP32/INT32) |
| `MATH` | Cycles that *either* FPU or SFPU was active (logical OR of the above two) |

**Key metric — FPU Execution Efficiency:** `FPU / FPU_INSTRN_AVAILABLE_1` — ratio of actual FPU execution to cycles an FPU instruction was queued. Distinguishes compute-bound (high) from memory-bound (low) workloads.

## UNPACK (11)

Monitors the unpacker pipeline — data movement from L1 into SrcA/SrcB register files and handoff to math.

| Counter | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `DATA_HAZARD_STALLS_MOVD2A` | Cycles stalled due to data hazards on MOVD2A (move-data-to-register-A) instructions — write-after-read / write-after-write register file conflicts |
| `MATH_INSTRN_STARTED` | Number of math instructions that began execution (**event count**, not cycles) |
| `MATH_INSTRN_AVAILABLE` | Cycles a math instruction was waiting in the buffer, ready to start but not yet issued |
| `SRCB_WRITE_AVAILABLE` | Cycles the SrcB register file write port was available (not blocked by backpressure from math) |
| `SRCA_WRITE_AVAILABLE` | Cycles the SrcA register file write port was available |
| `UNPACK0_BUSY_THREAD0` | Cycles unpacker 0 was busy on T0 (UNPACK thread) |
| `UNPACK1_BUSY_THREAD0` | Cycles unpacker 1 was busy on T0 |
| `UNPACK0_BUSY_THREAD1` | Cycles unpacker 0 was busy on T1 (MATH thread) |
| `UNPACK1_BUSY_THREAD1` | Cycles unpacker 1 was busy on T1 |
| `SRCB_WRITE` | Actual SrcB write completions (**event count** — number of data transfers written into SrcB) |
| `SRCA_WRITE` | Actual SrcA write completions (**event count** — number of data transfers written into SrcA) |

**Key metrics:**
- **Unpacker Write Efficiency:** `SRCA_WRITE / UNPACK0_BUSY_THREAD0` — fraction of busy time spent actually writing. Low ratio = unpacker busy but stalled (L1 contention or math backpressure).
- **Math Pipeline Utilization:** `MATH_INSTRN_STARTED / MATH_INSTRN_AVAILABLE` — close to 1.0 = healthy pipeline flow; low = instructions queued but pipeline stalled.
- **Backpressure Detection:** `SRCA_WRITE_AVAILABLE / UNPACK0_BUSY_THREAD0` — low ratio = unpacker busy but can't write because math hasn't consumed SrcA yet.

## PACK (3)

Monitors the packer pipeline — data movement from Dest register file back to L1.

| Counter | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `PACKER_DEST_READ_AVAILABLE` | Cycles destination register data was available for the packer to read (math has produced output and placed it in Dest) |
| `PACKER_BUSY` | Cycles the packer was actively working (moving data from Dest to L1) |
| `AVAILABLE_MATH` | Cycles math results were available for packing |

**Key metrics:**
- **Packer Efficiency:** `PACKER_DEST_READ_AVAILABLE / PACKER_BUSY` — close to 1.0 = math is feeding the packer well; low = packer waiting for math output (math is the bottleneck). Only valid with HW dvalid-based synchronization, not STALLWAIT mode.
- **Math-to-Pack Handoff:** `AVAILABLE_MATH / PACKER_BUSY` — low ratio = packer busy but math output isn't ready (math bottleneck).

## L1 bank 0 (8)

NOC Ring 0 traffic and L1 memory arbitration. Uses mux bit 4 = 0.

| Counter | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `NOC_RING0_INCOMING_1` | Cycles with incoming read/write transactions on NOC ring 0, channel 1, arriving at this tile |
| `NOC_RING0_INCOMING_0` | Cycles with incoming transactions on NOC ring 0, channel 0 |
| `NOC_RING0_OUTGOING_1` | Cycles with outgoing transactions on NOC ring 0, channel 1 |
| `NOC_RING0_OUTGOING_0` | Cycles with outgoing transactions on NOC ring 0, channel 0 |
| `L1_ARB_TDMA_BUNDLE_1` | Cycles the L1 arbiter granted access for TDMA bundle 1 (DMA engine had L1 bandwidth) |
| `L1_ARB_TDMA_BUNDLE_0` | Cycles the L1 arbiter granted access for TDMA bundle 0 |
| `L1_ARB_UNPACKER` | Cycles the L1 arbiter granted access for the unpacker (unpacker won arbitration for L1 bandwidth) |
| `L1_NO_ARB_UNPACKER` | Cycles the unpacker accessed L1 via the no-arbitration (bypass) path |

## L1 bank 1 (8)
