## Experimental Constants

The pack backend constants below came from real-pipeline profile counters and
standalone smoke attempts. Treat them as upper/perturbed bounds until the pack
path can be isolated without timeouts.

| constant | value | note |
|---|---:|---|
| `PACK_CB16_FINAL_L1ACC_OFF_CYCLES_PER_SUBBLOCK` | `5265` | validation failed in profiled run |
| `PACK_CB24_PARTIAL_L1ACC_OFF_CYCLES_PER_SUBBLOCK` | `7425` | validation failed in profiled run |
| `PACK_CB24_PARTIAL_L1ACC_ON_CYCLES_PER_SUBBLOCK` | `5265` | validation failed in profiled run |
| `PACK_COARSE_CYCLES_PER_SUBBLOCK` | `6345` | average suggested by pack report |

These numbers are much larger than the unperturbed fitted matmul subblock wall
of about `924 cycles/subblock`, so they should not replace the fitted constant
directly. They are still useful for identifying that standalone/profiled pack
is fragile and highly state-dependent.

## Matmul Interpretation

For the current `5000^3` DRISC matmul:

- `grid=10x10`
- `per_core=16x16`
- `bw=6`
- `num_blocks=27`
- `subblocks/core = 27 * 8 * 8 = 1728`
- `packed_tiles/core = 1728 * 4 = 6912`
- `final output tiles/core = 256`
- partial-pack multiplier is `27x`

Clean lower bounds per 2x2 subblock at `bw=6`:

| component | cycles/subblock |
|---|---:|
| math lower bound | `216` |
| math scaffold 2x2 latency | `187` |
| math scaffold 2x2 throughput | `244` |
| unpack measured | `487` |
| ready CB/semaphore overhead | tens of cycles |

The unperturbed whole-kernel fit was about `924 cycles/subblock` for the TRISC
pipeline. That leaves roughly `200 cycles/subblock` for pack/synchronization and
pipeline interaction after math and unpack. This fits the profile-level picture:
MVMUL alone is not the wall, and raw NoC bandwidth is not the wall. The slow
part is the coupled unpack/math/pack pipeline, with repeated partial pack/reload
caused by `27` K blocks.

## Remaining Gaps

- Isolated pack still needs a stable, validated harness.
- Blocking semaphore and CB waits need producer/consumer variants with known
release timing.
- DRISC DMA plus NoC stage overlap modes are implemented but timed out in this
session.
- The estimator needs a resource-queue model for overlap: RISC issue, NoC0,
NoC1, DRAM bank/controller, unpacker, math, packer, dest, L1 ports, and
semaphores.
- `TTMOP` and replay expansion should be represented explicitly rather than as
one static instruction.

## Current Estimator Scaffold

`microbenching/models/program_timing_model.py` is the first scaffold. It accepts/builds a
`Program`, infers matmul shape from RTAs, prints per-core role estimates, and
currently uses a coarse fitted TRISC subblock constant. The next step is to
replace that single fitted constant with the component constants above and a
simple resource scheduler.
