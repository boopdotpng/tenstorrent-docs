# NoC Hardware Sweep Manifest

This directory is intended to make the NoC scheduler/microbench results
self-contained when the repo is zipped and analyzed without hardware access.

Start here:

- `noc-scheduler-model.md`: current scheduler interpretation and remaining
  unknowns.
- `hardware-logs/*.txt`: raw `tt-device-queue` stdout for the hardware jobs
  listed below.
- The other markdown files in this directory contain curated report tables for
  the major successful sweeps.

## Notes For Offline Analysis

- The raw logs are stdout only. They do not include queue metadata beyond the
  job id encoded in the filename.
- `noc-scheduler-model.md` is the best single-file summary of conclusions.
- `noc-packet-latency.md`, `noc-arbitration.md`,
  `noc-dram-endpoint-matrix.md`, and `noc-same-initiator-active.md` contain the
  most scheduler-relevant detailed tables from the latest focused sweeps.
- Multicast detail is currently mostly in raw logs plus the scheduler summary.
  The runs passed, but the conversion from measurements to compact scheduler
  constants is still pending.
